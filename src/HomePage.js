        Raised in Lagos, Nigeria, I'm a creative fullstack developer, with keen
        interest in exploring the artistic possibilies of web development. I
        experiment and use unique designs in the building of products and the
        creation of immersive web experiences. Thus I am constantly learning and
        testing the limits of web element manipulation in the pursuit of new
        artistic expressions.
